It's [Wayward time](https://www.meetup.com/The-Junior-Dev-Struggle-Bus/events/ntrxgryzmbfc/) again, so grab a coffee and join us tonight for some code chat and general mingling. While you're there, we'd love to hear your ideas for new community projects. A few members have had some good ideas and we want to encourage people to talk about them openly and get involved collaborating with each other. 

Similarly, the [website](https://github.com/junior-dev-struggle-bus/juniordevstrugglebus) and [blog](https://github.com/junior-dev-struggle-bus/junior-dev-struggle-blog) have room for plenty of improvement and fixes. If you've never made a pull request before, these are safe opportunities to get your feet wet. We even leave some easier fixes out there to give others an opportunity to learn the process. If you're not ready for that, put in a GitHub Issue for someone else to tackle or just make a suggestion in the [JDSB Slack](https://www.juniordevstrugglebus.com/slack).

Shout out to [FizBuz](https://www.fizbuz.com)! Creator Carter Rabasa is trying to do some cool stuff with the platform, but it's still a work in progress. So, in his own words:

"Would love for junior devs to check it out and provide feedback. The goal is to help developers tell their story, no matter what their background is or how they came to tech."

Give the site and the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/FizbuzHQ/fizbuz) a look to learn more and if you like what you see, pass along some feedback to help make it the best it can be.
