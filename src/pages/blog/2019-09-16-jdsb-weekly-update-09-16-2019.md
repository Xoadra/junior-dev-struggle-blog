Hey, JDSB!

Some of you may have noticed a bit of oddity: this week is our first Monday off in quite a while. That's not a bad thing. We have always tried to provide some point of social contact every week, but sometimes it is good to have a breather. Rest assured that the Wayward meets haven't stopped and we will be back at our home base [on the 23rd](https://www.meetup.com/The-Junior-Dev-Struggle-Bus/events/ntrxgryzmbfc/) and every other Monday after. At the very least!

We have recently brought two more board members into the fold. So, with fresh blood in the mix, we are actively assessing where we want JDSB to head in the future. What we do best, what serves the community best, and what we have the bandwidth for as a meetup group and as an organization.

As always, we of course care how everyone in the community feels about that. So, please feel free to join on us on the [JDSB slack](https://www.juniordevstrugglebus.com/slack) and initiate a conversation about what JDSB means to you, what you would most like to see, or even how you may want to be involved. Shout it out in [\#general](https://jdsb.slack.com/messages/CK8KJ5AAF) or reach out to me (Brett Hurst) directly. Opening up a dialog at the next event is always an option as well.

In the meantime, chins up through the struggle and we will see you next week!

Brett
