It's another glorious [Wayward Monday](https://www.meetup.com/The-Junior-Dev-Struggle-Bus/events/ntrxgryznbkb/). Coffee, code, and camaraderie all under one roof. Next week is the return of the community social. We'll be gathering at a new location for JDSB: [Optimism Brewing Company](https://www.meetup.com/The-Junior-Dev-Struggle-Bus/events/265304439/)!

If it's been a while since you visited the JDSB website, be sure to check out and make use of the [resource page](https://juniordevstrugglebus.com/resources). Browse a collection of useful links and books as well as add your own favorites to the list. Once you've done that, hop on over to the [JDSB Slack](https://www.juniordevstrugglebus.com/slack) to discuss them.

While you're there, poke around the various channels. Ask for or provide some coding help, chat about your job search, or just share a good ol' fashioned meme. Maybe even share some thoughts on possible projects to open up for the community or find a pair programming partner. We have a community full of wonderful people, so take advantage! Get to know each other and you never know what might fall into place. :)
