We're excited to be having our first social meetup in a while as well as our first at [Optimism Brewing Company](https://optimismbrewing.com/). They are a great company that provides all-gender bathrooms and rejects tipping since they pay their employees a fair wage, so we're happy to bring JDSB into the space. Come [join us there this evening!](https://www.meetup.com/The-Junior-Dev-Struggle-Bus/events/265304439/)

That's about it for this week, folks. As always, come say "Hi!" and participate in the [JDSB Slack](https://www.juniordevstrugglebus.com/slack). :)
