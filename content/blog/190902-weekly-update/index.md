A very merry September to you, JDSB!

Since we shifted around our [Wayward schedule](https://www.meetup.com/The-Junior-Dev-Struggle-Bus/events/ntrxgryzmbdb/), today is an easy [Labor Day social at Fremont Brewing](https://www.meetup.com/The-Junior-Dev-Struggle-Bus/events/264177263/). If you don’t have any other holiday plans, come spend the evening with us!

Also remember to visit [Algorithms Anonymous](https://algorithms-anon.org/) — our forum for diving a little deeper into your favorite topics. It’s a place not just for algorithm challenges, but any conceptual curiosities or tech adjacent talk you can think of. Stir up a thread about exactly how the Node.js runtime functions under the hood, a new language or project you’re working on, recount your interview experiences, or draw attention to the social issues that are faced in tech.

As we saw a need for preserved content and asynchronous engagement, that became one of the primary goals of Algorithms Anonymous. Since Slack has a 10k message limit and you miss out on any discussion you weren't present for, a lot can get lost in the shuffle. It's also not easy to search for things that may have already been covered. Luckily, a forum solves these problems! You can visit an open topic no matter how old it is, or start your own, without the immediate pressure and pace of a chatroom. We're making a lot of iterative changes to the format, and we'd love to hear your ideas on what it should look like as it develops.

So spread the word, take advantage, and invite your friends! Same great JDSB community values in a forum package — what’s not to love? :)

We’re also working on implementing a CMS for the [JDSBlog](https://juniordevstruggleblog.com), so the community at large can more easily contribute content there, as well. Keep a look out in the [#jdsb-website-n-blog](https://jdsb.slack.com/messages/CLRSNKLAF) channel for the latest updates and maybe drop in and help guide the process with a PR or two. We try to keep our main projects open source and open to your feedback!

Of course, the [JDSB Slack](https://juniordevstrugglebus.com/slack) hasn’t and isn’t going anywhere, and any of the same topics are welcome in the real time domain there. So, come have a casual chat with fellow struggle bussers there, too. :) We're all about the options!

Have a safe holiday wherever you are, JDSB!
