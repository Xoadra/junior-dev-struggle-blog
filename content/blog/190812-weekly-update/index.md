#### This weeks event:

We're going event [casual at the Fremont Brewing company](https://www.meetup.com/The-Junior-Dev-Struggle-Bus/events/263877467/) again this week. So, if you're free, come enjoy a little sunshine, talk code, and get to know some of your fellow struggle bussers!

#### Recent developments:

Thanks to Mark, our Algorithms Anonymous project has carved out its own little nook on the web at [algorithms-anon.org.](https://algorithms-anon.org/) This helps us keep the activity from the slack channel tidy and preserved for future generations. It even crossposts into [#algorithms-anonymous](https://app.slack.com/client/TE1SMRZSP/CLJLJ5RDF)! So be sure to check out the site, and the channel.

[The Junior Dev Struggle Blog](https://juniordevstruggleblog.com/) is also making moves as Nate guides the project through a theme change and refactoring the code into tasty bite sized React components. Come on by the [#jdsb-website-n-blog](https://app.slack.com/client/TE1SMRZSP/CLRSNKLAF) channel to observe and contribute!

And to wrap up the week, we'd like to ask once more for a moment of your precious time regarding our [small weekend event survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/KBVW9NF), [#struggle-app-project](https://app.slack.com/client/TE1SMRZSP/CL8AP4KBP) hasn't gone anywhere, and if you haven't joined us on the [JDSB Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/jdsb/shared_invite/enQtNzA0NTY3OTE2ODg3LTE5ZTE5ODI5YmE5YTUzN2UyOWUxZmM1ZDZlNDliZTgxYTg0ODRlMmM3OThkY2JlZDRlNjIzYmJiMjNjNDBjOWQ) yet, what are you waiting for? :)
