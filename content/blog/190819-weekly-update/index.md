Thank you to the crowd from last week’s Fremont Brewing meetup. There were plenty of new faces, some of which we hope to see [tonight at the Wayward](https://www.meetup.com/The-Junior-Dev-Struggle-Bus/events/gfnvgryzlbzb/).

[Algorithms Anonymous](https://algorithms-anon.org), our friendly Stack Overflow-like environment for algorithms and other topics, has been a great early success! 

We’re looking for members to contribute challenges for the community to solve, as well as requests for problems. So, If you have a juicy algorithmic challenge to share or maybe you’re curious about some mathematical concept, share it with the rest of JDSB. Feedback on how the problems are presented or anything else you would like to see is also more than welcome.

Turning Algorithms Anonymous into an on-going event series is a part of the goal, so any suggestions or contributions will ultimately help guide us into that next step. If you haven’t been by the site yet, please check it out, and don't forget to drop by the [JDSB Slack](https://juniordevstrugglebus.com/slack) and the [#algorithms-anonymous](https://jdsb.slack.com/messages/CLJLJ5RDF) channel to chat with us there.

Of course, don’t forget to check in on some of our other projects and resources, including the JDSB [website](https://juniordevstrugglebus.com) and [blog](https://juniordevstruggleblog.com)(complete with a lovely new theme!), and the [Struggle Buddy](https://github.com/junior-dev-struggle-bus/struggle-slack-app) Slack app!

Keep calm and algo on, JDSB.
